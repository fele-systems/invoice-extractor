# invoice-extractor
Credit Card invoice extractor for personal use.

# Motivation
I've had a hard time using the bank apps or PDFs invoices to manage my spendings. I could see how much I'm wasting, but I wanted to have a more analytics view, so I could point if I was overwasting my money.
With this project, I want to be able to both categorize my spentings, unify all of the invoices I have, have a history and also a preview of future installments.

# Contributing
Feel free to use this application, request new features or report issues.

If you know how to code in Java with Spring feel free to implement new features, just be sure to open a Pull Request :)

And last but no least, I would be thankfull if you could give me some of your invoices to implement new extractors, as I'm limited to the only ones I use.
Currently, unfortunately, I have no way to hide personal data, but I'm planning on doing it on the future.
